# KelloggBot [Firefox]
Credit to SeanDaBlack for the basis of the script.

req.py is selenium python bot.

This version uses firefox instead of chrome and doesn't need an external driver (it auto installs it)

# Setup
Using pycharm makes this process easier

Install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python req.py` to run. It will loop until you kill the job. `ctrl + c` in your terminal to give the pro lifes a break (optional).
